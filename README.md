# Backbone-hotkeys

#About
  **Backbone Hotkeys** is an extension to the standard Backbone View which lets you easily add and remove handlers for
  keyboard events supporting almost any key combination.  Uses the *jquery.hotkey.js* library written by: [John Resig]
  (http://github.com/jeresig/jquery.hotkeys).

## Demo
  [Demo](https://rawgit.com/rpocklin/backbone-hotkeys/master/example/index.html)

## Event Types
  Supported types are `'keydown'`and `'keyup'`.

## How-to
  Include *jquery.hotkeys.js* and *backbone-hotkeys.js* after *backbone.js* in your app.

## Example

    App.SomeView = Backbone.View.extend({
      el: 'some-container',

      events: {
        'keyup[esc]       body': 'someMethod',
        'keyup[Alt+m]     body': 'someMethod',
        'keyup[Ctrl+left] body': 'someMethod'
      }

    });

## Notes
  If a selector is defined on a hotkey event then it is used as a filter for the target function.

  There are 4 arguments in the events binding, which are:

  * `keyup`: when key action should trigger the event
  * `[esc]`: the key (or key-combination, separated with +) to trigger the event
  * `body`: the DOM element this should bind to (ie. event must bubble up to this).
  * `someMethod`: The method to execute when a matching key combination is found (same as normal Backbone events).

## Compatibility
  Works with jQuery 1.8.3 and Backbone 1.1.2.

## Revision History
  * 1.2  Added automatic event unbinding for events bound to `document` - see #4.
  * 1.10 Bound to `document` as default and added jQuery selector parameter as filter for target function.
  * 1.0  Initial release
